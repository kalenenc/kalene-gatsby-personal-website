    <p>As some of you may know, I made the journey into transitioning into tech in 2015 after graduating college with a nursing degree.
      I realized that being a nurse was not the path I wanted to go down, but I still wanted to help people. As a member of Girl Develop It,
      I was able to tutor and teach students, but only after charging the mandated fee that was required for each individual class.</p>

      <p>
      I truly want to give back to the community in anyway I can, as I am so grateful everydate for the opporutnity to be in tech. That isn't to 
      say it is without any problems, but I am to make a career out of doing something I enjoy. </p>

      <p>
      I have learned a lot in the past almost three years of working in a corporate setting, but I'm ready for the next step in my journey--
      to be vulnerable in a new position, to ask lots of questions I'm hesitant to ask, and be a beginner in a new place all over again. </p>

    <p>I truly love to challenge myself; I wouldn't be where I am right now in life if that were the case.</p>

      <p>I'm just hoping to learn some new things and help some other people in the process, all while taking care of my own health and emotional wellbeing
      first and foremost.</p>

      <p>As a beautiful soul I admire on Instagram has said:</p>

      <blockquote>
      "There is no one way to be human. Your way is good. Your way is enough. Your way is beautiful. The more you show up fully as yourself, the more others 
      remember they can do the very same thing"</blockquote>

      <p>I'm hoping to be myself fully and encourage all may stumble upon my very small space on the internet, to be themselves fully as well.
</p>

      <p>Let's learn together.</p>
